# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
As a Data Analsyt for Pyber a ride share company I have been tasked with visualizing ride share data to present to the CEO and other shareholders. We have a goal to improve the access and affordability to Pyber ride sharing especially in underserved areas. The following explores the relationship between the type of city and the fare averages per driver and per ride. 
## Results
There are many differences in the ride share data by city type. Rural rides has the lowest total rides, Total drivers, Total Fares but has the highest Average Fare per ride and average fare per driver.

Rural cities have 5.3% of the total rides and 6.8% of total fares but only 2.6% of total drivers. 
While urban cities only have 62.7% of total fares and 68.4% of the total rides yet have 80.9% of the total drivers. 
Suburban cities hace 30.5% of the total fare, 26.3% of the total rides and only 16.5% of the drivers.

There is a negative realtionship between total number of rides in a city and the average fare goes down. As there are more rides in the city the fare amount goes down.

### Summary
The following are reccomendations to improve access and affordability:

- Offer more incentives for customers using Pyber in rural cities to lower the cost while building the market so that the average fare will start to decrease. 
- Limit the number of drivers in Urban cities so that the drivers can have a higher average fare. This will also encourage some of these drivers to work in either suburban or rurual areas.  
- Offer more incentives to drivers in Suburban area so that there will be a better ratio of total drivers to total rides to help decrease average fare cost. The most important time to do this would be when prices spike in February and April.
